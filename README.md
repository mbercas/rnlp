# rnlp
Natural Language Processing functions in Rust

## Objective
This is my first project in Rust, if fact it started as a simple function to test string slicing I copied learnt from one of the first chapters of the Rust tutorial and started evolving as I read more of the book and learnt some other features. 
I plan to keep learning Rust and adding more functionality here, in principle there is no real pla; Tokenization, WordVectors, text statistics, colocations, who knows.
At some stage I will compare the performance of my functions to those in the NLP library for Python. I hope to achieve better performance but who knows.
### Sub objectives
 - Use test driven development
 - Try CI in github
 - Refactor old code every time a new language feature is learnt
 - Generate documentation from code
### Caution
I make this repository public in case anyone is interested, but please be aware that for the time being I am at very early stages of Rust learning and things may be done in not exacly the best way.
